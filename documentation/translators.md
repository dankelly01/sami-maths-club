# Translators Documentation

## Joining the Project
All translations are managed online via a system called crowdin. You can join the project by clicking on the direct link: https://sami.crowdin.com/u/signup?hash=4599cd4afe3eb4dc3cbbebb9598e5f4616 

Alternative (if the link doesn't work), an email invite can be sent.

## Project Home Page

Here you will see a list of languages and current translation status. 
The bars may  be misleading, as text is first auto-translated (via google translate) before being verified. Therefore 100% translated does not mean that translation is complete.

Clicking on a language gives a full breakdown by problem

## Translation Editor Page

Text for translation is highlighted in yellow. You can see the current translation in the box on the right, alongside other possible recommendations. Make required changes to the translation and click save. 

Click the view toggle icon to see the problem as currently translated.

## Proofreading Page
When all text is translated correctly you can approve the final list of translations from the proofreading screen. You can toggle this screen from the menu bar breadcrumbs.
