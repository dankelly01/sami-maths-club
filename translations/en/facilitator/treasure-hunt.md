# Treasure Hunt

## Introduction  

There are two different approaches to this puzzle. You can assume that:  

•Each chest contains the treasure, or that  

•Each statement is true and consider the four cases that arise.

The way a student structures their answer will play a big part in how easy they find the answer.



## Solution  

<ins>Assumption 1<ins>  

The treasure is in chest A. That means that statement A must be the telling the truth. That also means that statement B is telling the truth. Since the treasure is in chest A, the treasure cannot be in chest C and therefore statement C is telling the truth.

There are three chests that are supposedly telling the truth, but there should only be one true statement. So the treasure cannot be in chest A.  

<ins>Assumption 2<ins>  

The treasure is in chest C. That means that statement C must be lying. The treasure is not in chest A or D, making those statements lies as well. Meaning that statement B is also a lie.

None of the chests are telling the truth, but there should be one true statement. So the treasure cannot
be in chest C.  

<ins>Assumption 3<ins>  

The treasure is in chest D. That means that statement B and D are telling the truth. Statement A must be lying since the treasure is not in chest A. Since the treasure is not in chest C, statement C must be telling the truth.

There are three chests that are supposedly telling the truth, but there should only be one true statement.
So the treasure cannot be in chest D.  

<ins>Assumption 4<ins>  

The treasure is in chest B. That means that the treasure is not in A or D, making those statements a lie.Now we know the treasure is not in chest A or D, then statement B must also be a lie. Since the treasure is not in chest C, this statement is true.

Only one statement is telling the truth. **This means that the treasure is in chest B.**
