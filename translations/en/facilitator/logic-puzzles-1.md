# Logic Puzzles 1

## Introduction
Puzzles encourage people to think in different ways. These puzzles rely more on **thinking** than knowledge, so any learner can attempt them. There may be many right answers, and different approaches to the problems. Most important is not to let learners give their answers to each other, let everybody attempt all the questions and then discuss later. 

Find the solutions is **not important**, it is about the thinking process learners go through in trying.

## Solutions
1.	First, fill the 3 litre jug so it is full. Pour the 3 litres into the 5 litre jug. Then fill the 3 litre jug again. Pour this into the 5 litre jug. When the 5 litre jug becomes full, you will have 1 litre left in the 3 litre jug. 

2.	Light both ends of the first rope and one end of the second rope. Once the first rope has burnt, light the other end of the second rope. Once the second rope has burnt, 45 minutes will have passed. Why? If you light both ends one of the first rope it will take 30 minutes to burn completely. After this, the second rope will need a further 30 minutes to burn, so if you light the other end as well, it will take 15 minutes to burn completely. Overall this will take 45 minutes.

3.	First, fill the 5 litre bucket so it is full. Pour 3 litres into the 3 litre bucket. The 5 litre bucket now contains 2 litres. Empty the 3 litre bucket and pour the 2 litres into the empty 3 litre bucket. Now fill the 5 litre bucket. You now have 2 + 5 = 7 litres in the buckets! (There may be many different ways to do this, any is correct if you have followed the rules!)

## Extension
What are all the different amounts we can measure using the 5 litre and 3 litre buckets? 
What about for 4 litre and 2 litre buckets? What is the difference here?
Get students to come up with their own bucket and water puzzles. Make sure they check that they are possible! Try different size buckets or even add another bucket.
