# Counting Squares

## Introduction

This problem rewards those who can work systematically and devise a strategy to ensure that no squares are left out. You should let the learners at first try the problem and see if they get different answers, ask them to try and figure out why this is and explain their solutions to each other. This will be hard to do unless learners have come up with ways to record their findings. If learners are struggling you may want to get them to actually cut out different sized squares that they can manipulate on their board to assist with counting and record results in a table.

## Solution

There are **50 squares**, made up as follows:

Non-rotated: 16 one by one, 9 two by two, 4 three by three, 1 four by four

Rotated: 9 + 8 + 2 + 1 (varying sizes)

## Extension

Instead of using a 5x5 dotted grid you can try other sizes and see if it is possible to generalize to nxn  
(note, there is a formula but it uses n4 (n to the power 4) so it may not be immediately obvious.

Below are the solutions for the first 6 grid sizes (from 2x2 up to 7x7)  
1, 6, 20, 50, 105, 196
