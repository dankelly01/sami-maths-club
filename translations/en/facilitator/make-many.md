# Make Many

## Introduction

This type of puzzle comes from a TV show. The first task should help students practice techniques to use in
Task 2. Students might be surprised at how many numbers you can make using only 100, 2 and 3. The full version of the game is presented in the game ‘Countdown’ (page 19)   

Students could start on their own and then share their answers to see if as I group they can find them all.   
Don’t tell them there are 19 until they get there!   

## Solution

**Task 1**   

100, 101, 102, 103, 105, 106, 150, 194, 197, 200, 203, 206, 294, 298, 300, 302, 306, 500, 600   
Some of the tricky ones are, e.g. 194 = (100 − 3) × 2   

It shows how useful brackets are!   

**Task 2**   

Here is one way to solve each problem. Students may come up with other correct solutions – just check they have only used each number once!   

635 = 6 × 100 + 7 × 5   

667 = 6 × 100 + 50 + 5 + 5 + 7   

665 = 7 × (100 − 5)

564 =6 × (100 − 7 + $\frac{5}{5}$ )   

785 = 7 × 100 + 50 + 5 × 6 + 5

202 = = (7 − 5) × (100 +$\frac{5}{5}$ )   

420= 6 × 7 × 100 ÷ (5 + 5)   

419 = (7 × 6 × 50 − 5) ÷ 5
