# Special Numbers

## Introduction

This problem comes from the Nrich website with additional notes: http://nrich.maths.org/2129    

The problem allows students to explore properties of numbers and start learning how to make *conjectures* (rules that they think might exist).  

Give the class some time to look for special numbers - once a few have been found, more will quickly follow. Once there is a consensus that a group of special numbers has been found, bring the class together and share what they think is going on. Ask them "Are you sure you've found all the special numbers? How could we be certain?" For this we need algebra.

## Solution

Introduce the class to the algebraic representation of the problem.   

Ask them, "If the first digit of the number is *a* and the second digit is *b*, what are expressions for the sum
and product of the digits?" Students should work out it is *a* + *b* for the **sum** and *ab* or *axb* for the **product.**
If they don't see this, show them with some examples with numbers in place of *a* and *b*.   

Next, how can we write the number as an algebraic expression? This is harder, you will probably need to show students that the number can be written as 10*a* + *b*. For example, 35 can be written as 3 × 10 + 5, because 3 is the tens digit and 5 is the units digit.   

Now we have an equation: 10*a* + *b* = (*a* + *b*) + (*a* × *b*) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(number = sum + product)   

Subtract *b* from both sides and subtract *a* from both sides to get 9*a* = *a* × *b*. Divide by *a* because *a* is not zero and we get *b* = 9. This means any number with unit digit 9 will work. Try all 9 possibilities 19, 29, ...,
99 to check that it works.   

If some students are not familiar with algebraic expressions, show them the extension questions.

## Extension

Then present the suggestions for other types of special numbers:
* I add twice the tens digit to the units digit, then add this to the product of the digits. I get back to my original number.   
* I add three times the tens digit to the units digit, then add this to the product of the digits. I get back to my original number.   
* I add four times... or five times... or...  

Can you work out which number are special using these definitions?   

Can you use algebra to help you to find these special numbers?
