# Letter Matching

## Introduction

You should only play this game after you have played Tic-tac-toe!   

This games requires that you to keep track of yours and your opponents words, think ahead and predict what your opponent will do. Like Tic-tac-toe you need to develop a strategy if you want to win this game.   

It is usually harder for students to develop a strategy for this game than for Tic-tac-toe. Ask the students whether they think this game is easier or harder than Tic-tac-toe, and why.

## Solution

Discuss with the students the differences between playing the game in a line and playing in the square. Discuss these questions.   

* Is it easier to play the game in the square or in a line? Why?
* Do you get more wins, losses or draws?
* What is special about the arrangement of the square?
* Is playing in the square similar to anything you have played before?   

If you have also played 15 game you can see if students notice the similarities with this game (they are basically the same game, called isomorphic games). After playing in the square a few times, students should realise that to get three words that share a letter they just
need to get three words in a line. This is because if you look at the words in each horizontal, vertical and diagonal line, they all contain a common letter.

That is why this is a special arrangement of the letters!   

We have now transformed the game into getting a line of 3 words. This means that it is basically the same game (isomorphic) as **Tic-tac-toe!**   

Students usually say that Tic-tac-toe is an easier game to play than this game, but we have shown that we can transform this game so that we are basically playing Tic-tac-toe again and made the game easy.   

In mathematics we often change the way we look at things to make them easier for us. It is a very powerful tool. Here we have transformed a hard game (Letter matching) into an easy one (Tic-tac-toe). With this knowledge, students should be much better at Letter Matching now.

## Extension

Can students come up with their own words to play this game? They must be able to write them in a square like above for the game to work!
