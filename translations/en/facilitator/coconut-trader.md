# Coconut Trader

## Introduction  

The key to this question is to realise that you should take all the coconuts from one sack until that sack is empty. Then do the same with the second sack. If each time you reach a checkpoint you take one coconut from each sack, then you would have no coconuts left by the time you reach the market! Leave students to work this out for themselves but if they get stuck then give them a hint.



## Solution  

<ins>Emptying the first sack<ins>

You currently have three sacks so at each checkpoint you must give three coconuts each time. That means that the sack will be empty after 30 ÷ 3 = 10 checkpoints.You throw away this empty sack.  

<ins>Emptying the second sack<ins>

You now have two sacks left so at each checkpoint you must give two coconuts each time. That means that the sack will be empty after 30 ÷ 2 = 15 checkpoints. You throw away this empty sack.  

<ins>Emptying the third sack<ins>  

You now have one sack left so at each checkpoint you must give one coconut each time. You have already passed 10 + 5 = 15 checkpoints, which means you have five checkpoints left. That means you must give
out 5 × 1 = 5 coconuts from your final bag.  

Therefore, you are left with 30 − 5 = 25 coconuts to sell at the market.


## Extension  

Here are two more puzzles to solve:  

1.<ins>Cars across the desert<ins>

A car must carry an important person across the desert.   

There is no petrol station in the desert and the car has space only for enough petrol to get it half way across the desert.  

There are also other identical cars that can transfer their petrol into one another.  

How can we get this important person across the desert?
