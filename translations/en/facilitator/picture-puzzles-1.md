# Picture Puzzles 1

## Introduction

These problems can all be solved in different ways, but it is recommended you encourage students to use logic and reasoning skills instead of guessing numbers. Usually each line gives you a piece of information that you can use in the next, so you should think carefully about each piece of information before moving onto the next. The problems also get harder as you go, so encourage students to start with the top-left puzzle first.
