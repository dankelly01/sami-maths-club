# Patience

After one team wins the first round, ask the winning team to explain how they won.
Ask the others teams what they could do differently to turn over the cards faster. Get them to think about strategy.   

Play the game a few times until the students get the idea of strategically replacing incorrect cards in order
to minimize the number of times the same cards are turned over. With 10 cards, the best strategy will accomplish the task in 19 moves or less, with a minimum of 10 turns if there are no mistakes. With no
strategy, the game can go on forever.   

Students should understand that just going very fast is not the best method. If they have a good strategy,they can finish faster than a team running fast without a strategy.   

There may be many different strategies used by different teams. It is good to have a discussion about different strategies and think which ones will be better than others.
