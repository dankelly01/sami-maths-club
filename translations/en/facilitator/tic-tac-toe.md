# Tic Tac Toe

## Introduction

This game is designed to get students to think about strategy when play games. After students have played the game for a while ask them some of these questions.

- What is the best way to play this game?
- Is it better to go first or second?
- Where is the best position to start from?
- Are the rules the only thing you need to know to win the game or is there something more?
- What is strategy and how does it relate to this game?
- What are some of the strategies to playing this game?
- Should you play this game randomly or should you think about your moves?

After discussing some of these things get the students to play again, and this time tell them to think about strategy and think about your moves.

After playing again they should find they are getting more draws. Ask them why this is.

If you are getting lots of draws it is because both players have become better at the game and have learnt how to play better.

To be good at this game requires mathematical thinking. You have to learn the strategies to become good at the game through practice and by thinking carefully about your moves. When you lose a game you should try to understand why and make sure it doesn't happen next time.

## Extension

After doing this activity or in your next session you can try the activity 15 game. It is another game that requires this type of thinking. Follow the instructions on the sheet.
