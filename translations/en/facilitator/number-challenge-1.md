# Number Challenge 1

## Introduction

Puzzles encourage people to think in different ways. These puzzles rely more on **thinking** than knowledge,
so any learner can attempt them. There may be many right answers, and different approaches to the problems. Most important is not to let learners give their answers to each other, let everybody attempt all
the questions and then discuss later.  

The solutions are **not important**, it is about the thinking process learners go through in trying.

## Solution

1. The first two numbers add up to 11 so we can try different pairs. If they were 5 and 6 then the other number would have to be 12 or 13 but then none of the pairs add up to 22, so it's wrong. If we keep trying values we see that the first numbers can only be 3 and 8 and the other number will be 14 which works with all the information. However, if the numbers were bigger this would take much longer.  

    A better way is to use **algebra** and **simultaneous equations.** Let the three numbers be x, y and z , and . If the first pair is x and y , then we know that x + y =13. If the second pair is x and z  then,  x + z = 17  and the last pair must be y  and z so y + z = 22. This gives us three simultaneous equations:
  x + y = 11 ;  x + z = 17    ;   y + z = 22  
  
   Equation 2 - Equation 1 gives: z - y = 6 . Now add this to Equation 3 to get 2z = 28. 
Which means z = 14 . Using the original equations we can then work out that  x = 3 

      and y = 8.

   Now try the question if the totals were 73, 140 and 109. Which method is faster now?

   This questions is all about being **systematic** - having a logical system to check all possibilities.

      Start with the two 1s and work out what number can go between them. You will see that 3 is not possible.

      Do the same and you will see it's not possible to have a 2 or a 4 between the 1s. You can solve it from there.

3.  99 + $\frac{9}{9}$ = 99 +1 = 100 or even $\frac{99}{99}$ = 100.  
   This question requires some creativity!
