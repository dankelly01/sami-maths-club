# Geometry Puzzle 1

## Introduction

Puzzles encourage people to think in different ways. These puzzles rely more on thinking than knowledge, so any learner can attempt them. There may be many right answers, and different approaches to the problems. Most important is not to let learners give their answers to each other, let everybody attempt all the questions and then discuss later. 
Find the solutions is not important, it is about the thinking process learners go through in trying.

## Solutions

1. Let the radius of the Earth be R metres. Then the circumference, is 2$\pi$R metres. Which means the piece of string is also 2$\pi$R metres long. If we extend the string by 1 metre then the string is now 2$\pi$R+1 metres long. If we make a circle with this length then what is the new radius? If we make a circle with this string it means the circumference  =2$\pi$R + 1 metres. If the new radius is S then circumference =2$\pi$S. But we also know circumference = 2$\pi$R + 1, the length of the string. So, 2$\pi$S=2$\pi$R+1. We solve this for S. Divide both sides by 2$\pi$ to get S = R + $\frac{1}{\pi}$. 
   
   So S is $\frac{1}{\pi}$ metres longer than R. $\frac{1}{\pi}$ metres is about 0.16 metres, enough maybe for a cat to pass under! Surprisingly, you might have noticed we didn't need to know anything about the size of the Earth for this. What would the gap be if we did it with a football instead of the Earth?

2. First, cut the cake into 4 equal pieces with vertical cuts. Then make one horizontal cut in the middle of the cake to cut the four pieces into 8 equal pieces.

3. If we want 5 rows of 4 trees with only 10 trees, then each tree will have to appear in two different rows.
