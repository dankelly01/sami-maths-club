# 15 Game

## Introduction

You should only play this game after you have played Tic-tac-toe!   

This games requires that you can do some mental calculations and you can think ahead and predict what your opponent will do. Like Tic-tac-toe you need to develop a strategy if you want to win this game.   

It is usually harder for students to develop a strategy for this game than for Tic-tac-toe. Ask the students whether they think this game is easier or harder than Tic-tac-toe, and why.

## Solution

Discuss with the students the differences between playing the game in a line and playing in the square.
Discuss these questions.
* Is it easier to play the game in the square or in a line? Why?
* Do you get more wins, losses or draws?
* What is special about the arrangement of the square?
* Is playing in the square similar to anything you have played before?   

After playing in the square a few times, students should realise that to get 15 they just need to get a line of
three numbers in a row. This is because if you look at the numbers in each horizontal, vertical and diagonal
lines, they all add up to 15. That is why this is a special arrangement of the numbers, it is called a **magic square.**    

We have now transformed the game into getting a line of 3 numbers. This means that it is basically the
same game as **Tic-tac-toe!**    

Students usually say that Tic-tac-toe is an easier game to play than 15 Game, but we have shown that we
can transform this game so that we are basically playing Tic-tac-toe again.   

In mathematics we often change the way we look at things to make them easier for us. It is a very powerful tool. Here we have transformed a hard game (15 Game) into an easy one (Tic-tac-toe). With this knowledge, students should be much better than the 15 Game now.


## Extension

Are there any other arrangements of the numbers that will make a magic square? How many are there?
