Two player game, played on two rows of squares
(any length)

Players take turns to colour in **any two adjacent** squares. The first player who canâ€™t make such a move is the **loser.**   

Example: After Red's 4 <sup>th</sup> turn, Blue cannot make another move and loses.

**Variation:** Play the game with just one row of
squares.
