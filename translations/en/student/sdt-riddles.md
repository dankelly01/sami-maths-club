# Speed, Distance, Time Riddles

The speed of a moving object is equal to the distance which is moves divided by the time which the movement takes.  
These three measurements are very important across many areas of applied maths, physics and engineering.  
Here are three puzzles related to speed, distance and time. Be warned, your first thought may not be correct!

## Speed

A bird flies at 30km/h from its nest to a tree. It then returns from the tree to its nest at 60km/h.  
What is the average speed of the bird for the entire round trip?

## Distance

You are trying to cross a desert in a car however all of the vehicles that you have access to can only hold enough fuel to travel half the distance you need.  
Assuming that you can move fuel from one car to another, can you think of a way to make the trip?  
How many cars (and drivers!) will you need?

## Time

The amount of water in a lake doubles every day.  
If the lake is half full after 10 days, how many days until the lake take is completely full?
