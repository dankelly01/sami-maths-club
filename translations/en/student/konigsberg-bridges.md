# Bridges of Konigsberg

The Prussian city of Konigsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) is divided into four landmasses by the river Pregel.

You can see that there are seven bridges connecting these sections of the city.

Can you find a way to walk through the city crossing each bridge exactly once?

Do you think that it is possible?

Assume that there are no other ways to cross the river than by walking over one of these bridges. You may begin and end anywhere in the city.
