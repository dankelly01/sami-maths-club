# River Crossing  

A farmer bought a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage from the market. To get home he must cross a river by boat, but the boat is very small and he must shuttle the items across one by one.  

 The wolf cannot be left alone on the same side of the river as the goat (since the goat will be eaten) and the goat cannot be left alone on the same side of the river as the cabbage (since the cabbage will be eaten).

How can the farmer move the wolf, the goat, and the cabbage across the river while making sure that nothing gets eaten while heâ€™s away?
