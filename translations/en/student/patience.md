# Patience

This is a relay race requiring strategy to win. You will need a set of cards for each team with the numbers 1 through 10 written
on them. You can use playing cards Ace through 10 or you can create your own cards. You will also need a long table on which to place a set of cards for each team.   

Divide the class up into teams of about ten students. Each team should have a monitor who will randomly spread out that teamâ€™s set of cards face side down on the table and ensure that the rules are followed.   

Team members line up and the first member of each team will run over to the table from a set distance and turn over a card. If the card turned over is a one, the card is left face up and the next student on that team tries to turn over a two. If the one is not turned over by the first student, the card is turned back over and the next student has to try to turn over a one and so on until a one is uncovered.   

As it is a relay race, each student who turns over a card has to
return to his team and tap the next person before that person
can proceed. The goal is to be the first team to turn over all the
cards in order.
