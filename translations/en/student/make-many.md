# Make Many

**<u style="color:green;">Task 1</u>**

How many different three digit numbers can you make
using only the numbers 100, 2 and 3 at most once and as many of the operators + − × ÷ and brackets as you like?

e.g. 100 ×(2+3) = 500

100 x 3 = 300

100 + 3 + 2 =105

**<u style="color:green;">Task 2</u>**

Using the numbers in the blue box, try and make all of the
three digit target numbers. Hopefully Task 1 will have
made you think of some tricks for the harder ones!
