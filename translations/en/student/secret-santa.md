A group of friends want to buy one present each and everyone wants to receive one present (Secret Santa). The rules of a Secret Santa are that each personâ€™s name is put in a hat and the names are mixed. Then each person must choose 1 name from the hat. If you choose your own name, you must put it back in the hat (and all start again if necessary!).

If **2 people** do a secret santa there is only one way: Person A gives to person B and person B gives to
person A.

**3 people**: With 3 people, there are 2 possible ways.  
Can you think why?

**4 people**: Now how many different ways are there with 4 people?

The final challenge is to find the number of different
scenarios with **5 people**.
