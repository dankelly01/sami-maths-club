The King of a small country invites 1000 guests to his annual party. Each guest brings the King a bottle of wine. Soon after, the Queen discovers that one of the guests is trying to assassinate the King by giving him a bottle of poisoned wine. Unfortunately, they do not know which guest, nor which bottle of wine is poisoned. Just a single drop of the poisoned wine would kill the King.

The King has some prisoners in his dungeon. He decides to use them as taste testers to determine which bottle of wine contains the poison. 

The poison, when taken, has no effect until exactly 24 hours later when the drinker suddenly dies. The King needs to determine which bottle of wine is poisoned by tomorrow so that the festivities can continue as planned. Hence he only has time for one round of testing. How can the King administer the wine to the fewest number of prisoners to ensure that 24 hours from now he is guaranteed to have found the poisoned wine bottle?
