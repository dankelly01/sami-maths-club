# Number Challenge 1

1. John thinks of three numbers. He picks two of
them and adds them to get 11. He does this again
and gets 17 and again to get 22.  
What are the three numbers?  
Is there a method to do this for any three totals?    

2. Write the numbers 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3 in a line such that
there is one number between the 1s, two numbers
between the 2s and three numbers between the 3s.

    Harder: add two 4s and make sure there are four
numbers between the 4s.  
3. Write an equation that only uses the digits 9,9,9,9
and equals 100.
