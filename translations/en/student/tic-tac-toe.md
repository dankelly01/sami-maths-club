This is a 2 player game.

One person has the **O** symbols the other has **X**.

Take it in turns to put one of your symbols in an
empty space.

The winner is the first
person to get 3 of their symbols in a line (horizontal, vertical or diagonal).

**Example**

Player **X** is the winner because they have 3 **X**s in diagonal line.
