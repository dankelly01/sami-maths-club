# Coconut Trader  

You are a coconut trader and you are
travelling to the market to sell your coconuts.
You are carrying 3 sacks with 30 coconuts in each. No sack can hold more than 30
coconuts.  


On the way to the market you have to pass
through 30 checkpoints and on each
checkpoint you have to give 1 coconut for
each sack you are carrying.  

Once a sack is empty it should be left behind.  

How many coconuts are left in the end?
