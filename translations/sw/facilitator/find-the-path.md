# Find The Path

## Introduction

For this task students must be prepared to make several attempts before they get the solution. Remind students that getting an incorrect path is not bad. Students should be able to improve on incorrect paths and learn from them to get to the solutions.

## Solution

**Can you make exactly 53?**  
There is more than one way to make 53. Here is one path:  
5 + 7 + 6 + 6 + 9 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 4 = 53 ![image description](https://github.com/supportingami/sami-maths-club/blob/master/maths-club-pack/images/find-the-path-2.png?raw=true) Can you find any others?

**Can you make exactly 60?**  
One way to make 60 is:  
5 + 5 + 8 + 6 + 9 + 9 + 7 + 7 + 4 = 60 ![image description](https://github.com/supportingami/sami-maths-club/blob/master/maths-club-pack/images/find-the-path-3.png?raw=true)

**What is the smallest possible number you can get?**  
Students need to be systematic when creating paths and have a good system of recording their paths and their lengths.

The shortest path length is 48. There are different ways to get 48. Here is one way. ![image description](https://github.com/supportingami/sami-maths-club/blob/master/maths-club-pack/images/find-the-path-4.png?raw=true) Can you find any others?
