# Adding To 15

## Introduction

15 is a game to challenge students to develop strategy and think mathematically. Many students will just try to guess where to place each number, perhaps randomly at first, but then should start to think strategically. Mental maths skills are used throughout the activity.

It may be useful for learners to use pieces of paper with numbers written on so that they can easily manipulate their answers, instead of writing them all on paper.

## Solution

The secret here is to consider the total of all of the numbers used. We know that each number will be used once, so the overall total is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 36

We also know that the total of each of the rows and columns must be 15. If we just consider the rows

We therefore know that the value of the 2 circles in the middle must be 36 â€“ 30 = 6

Similarly, the two values in the middle of the other sides must also be 6. Once we place numbers totaling 6 in the centre there are multiple solutions which can be found, e.g.,

## Extension

The activity worked when the total in each row and column had to be 15. Will it work for any other totals? Can you explain why?
