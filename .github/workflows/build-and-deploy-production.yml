        #   TODO - could also consider publishing to appetize or similar
        # NOTE - would require building debug apk/ipa
        # NOTE - could be called from another workflow via https://github.com/marketplace/actions/workflow-dispatch
        # NOTE - could persist apk/ipa across workflows via https://jfrog.com/artifactory
