# Syracuse's Conjecture

A Syracuse sequence is a sequence of whole numbers defined in the following way: start from any whole number bigger than zero, and:

1. If it's even, divide by 2.
2. If it's odd, multiply by 3 and add 1.

Once we arrive at 1, the sequence is finished.

For example, starting from 10:

10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

So the sequence has 7 figures. The challenge is now to find as long a sequence as possible!

Furthermore, do you think there exists a sequence that never goes to 1?
