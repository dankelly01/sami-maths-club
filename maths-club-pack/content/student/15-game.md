This is a 2 player game. Take it in turn to pick one number at a time.   

The winner is the first person to have exactly three numbers that add up to 15. **Example**

The player using squares has won because 4 + 5 + 6 = 15. The player
using circles has 7 and 8 which makes 15 but you only win if you have **exactly 3** numbers that make 15.   

After playing many times now write the numbers in a square like this
and play the same game again.
