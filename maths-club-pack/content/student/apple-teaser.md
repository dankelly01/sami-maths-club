You each have a box of apples in your room. You can count the number of
apples in your own box, but not in anyone else’s.  

     • Each room has at least one apple  

     • No room has more than nine apples  

     • Each room has a different number of apples  

The rules of the challenge are: The three of you will get to ask Ruben one question, which he will answer truthfully with *“Yes”*or *“No”*. Everyone hears the questions and the answers. Ruben will release you if **one of you** tells him the total number of apples in the three rooms.  

*Adam: “Is the total number of apples an even number?”*

*Ruben: “No”*  

*Belle: “Is the total number of apples a prime number?”*  

*Ruben: “No”*  

You count five apples in your box.  **What question will you ask?**
