# Colouring Maps

Start by drawing an empty square:

<img src="../../images/colouring-maps-1.png" width=200>

Create a *map* by dividing the square into seperate regions. For example:

<img src="../../images/colouring-maps-2.png" width=200>

Now colour in your map such that there are no regions of the same colour which share an edge.

Try to find the smallest number of different colours which you need to be able to do this.

What about other maps, can you find a certain number of colours which are able to colour in any map?
