# Where on Earth?

For this question, you should assume that the Earth is a perfect sphere.

I begin a journey from somewhere on the surface of the earth.  
Firstly, I travel 1km south.  
Next, I travel 1km east.  
Finally, I travel 1km north.  
At this point, I find that I am in the same point that I started my journey.

Can you say where on the Earth I started and ended my journey?
