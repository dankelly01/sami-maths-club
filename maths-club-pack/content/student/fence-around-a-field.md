# Fence Around A Field 

A fence of exact length is build around a square field  

![](../../images/fence-around-a-field-1.png)  

If there was an additional 1m of fencing, how much gap would there be between the field and the fence?     
(Assume equal space is left around all sides)

Is it enough space for a mouse to fit through? How about a tractor?
