# Kaprekar's Number

Choose a four digit number where the digits are not all the same (so not 1111, 2222, ...).

Rearrange the digits to get the largest and smallest numbers that these digits can make.

Subtract the smallest number from the largest to get a new number, and carry on repeating this operation for each new number.

For example, starting with 4252:

5422 - 2245 = 3177  
7731 - 1377 = 6354  
6543 - 3456 = 3087  
...

What do you notice as you continue this process?  
What happens when you use different starting numbers?

Does something similar happen for three digit numbers?
