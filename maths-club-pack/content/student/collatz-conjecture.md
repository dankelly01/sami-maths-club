# Collatz Conjecture  

Think of a positive integer  

If it is even, halve it  

It if is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1  

Repeat this process with your new number  

Keep going, but stop if you get to the number 1  

For example, if you chose the number 6 you
would get this sequence:

Try some numbers of your own.  

Can you find some short sequences?  

Can you find some long sequences?  

Do you always reach the number 1?
