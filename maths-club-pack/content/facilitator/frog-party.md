# Frog Party

## Introduction

This is a really fun problem, and can be used to build many much harder problems. It is important when starting to problem to make sure the rules are clear. You might want to do this by showing examples of moves which are and are not allowed, using coins on top of pieces of paper or similar.

## Solution

There are many ways to solve this, and it is possible to have a party on every single lily pad. Two examples are given below, however you should ask students to also share their solutions

## Extension

There are lots of ways you can make this problem more challenging and interesting,
which include:   

 |Statement|Picture|
|---|---|
|Add more lily pads, is it still possible with 6, 10 or N?|![](../../images/frog-party-4.png)|
| Choose one of the frogs to be the Queen frog, who must be at the top of the party|![](../../images/frog-party-5.png)|
|Swap one of the frogs for a lazy toad, who refuses to move. Is it still possible?|![](../../images/frog-party-6.png)|


Note, the strategy used in the second solution of working from the inside out also works
for any number of lily pads!
