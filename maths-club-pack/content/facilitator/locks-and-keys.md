# Locks and Keys

## Introduction

This problem is not specified very precisely, and in this case it is intentional. The aim of this problem is to work with assumptions. The problem has different solutions under different assumptions, and it might be
easy or even impossible depending on the assumptions. For example, if we assume that the messenger can break the box or the lock, then the problem is impossible (and somewhat pointless).   

There is no right or wrong solution because there is no right or wrong set of assumptions. However, if we specify our assumptions clearly, then for the given set of assumptions any solution is either right or wrong.
The facilitator should encourage students to decide on what should be allowed or not so that the problem is not solved too easily or made impossible.   

This activity involves lots of discussion between groups. It could help to have paper cutouts of locks, keys and boxes so students can demonstrate rather than only explain. You should encourage students to demonstrate their solutions, and to challenge each other to see if they can find a way to intercept.   

## Solution

Thereâ€™s are lots of different strategies that could be tested and argued, here we will only outline a few possibilities, it is up to the students and facilitator to decide if their own solutions work or not.   

We will start with a few assumptions:   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The messenger cannot break the box or the lock.   

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The messenger cannot make copies of keys.   

**Case 1:** Alice locks the box and sends it to Bob. Bob sends the messenger back to Alice. Alice now gives the messenger the key to send it to Bob. The messenger gives the key to Bob and Bob unlocks the box.   

**Intercept:** The messenger only pretends to deliver the box to Bob, but instead keeps it. He then returns it back to Alice and obtains the key to unlock the box and read the message.   

**Case 2:** Alice sends the key using a different messenger than for the box.   

**Intercept:** The messengers collaborate. You would need to decide in the rules whether this would be possible.   

**Case 3:** Alice locks the box with her lock and sends it to Bob. Bob attaches his own lock and sends it back.Alice takes her lock off the box and sends it back again. Finally, Bob takes his own lock off to read the message.   

**Intercept:** In this case there would be no way to intercept the message without breaking the box or copying keys!

## Extension

Bob opens the box and see it is instructions to play a game. To start the game Alice and Bob will flip a coin to decide who goes first, however they will still need the messenger to communicate the outcome. Who should flip the coin? Who should choose heads or tails? How can they communicate in a way so that neither person can cheat?
