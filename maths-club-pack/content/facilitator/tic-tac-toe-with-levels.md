# Tic Tac Toe with levels

## Introduction

This game is best played after playing the simpler Tic-Tac-Toe (G1 sheet). This is a variation of Tic-Tac-Toe that has much more variation. This game is designed to get students to think about having a strategy to win the game. After students have played the game for a while ask them some of these questions.   

* What is the best way to play this game?
* Is it better to go first or second?
* Where is the best position to start from?
* Are the rules the only thing you need to know to win the game or is there something more?
* What is strategy and how does it relate to this game?
* What are some of the strategies to playing this game?
* Should you play this game randomly or should you think about your moves?

If you have previously played original Tic-Tac-Toe, ask the students what are the similarities and differences between this game and Tic-Tac-Toe. Some questions to discuss include:   

* Which game is easier to win? Why?
* Which game requires more thinking, and why?
* Are the strategies you thought of for both games similar in any way? How?   

Student should realise that this game is much more complex than original Tic-Tac-Toe which has a clear strategy to avoid losing. In fact, even a computer analysing the game could not find a winning strategy for Tic-Tac-Toe with levels. This should show students how even simple games can require lots of
mathematical thinking, strategy and logic.

## Extension

Add another row so you now have a 4 x 3 grid. Use the same rules. Does this make the game harder or easier?
