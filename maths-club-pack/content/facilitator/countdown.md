# Countdown

## Introduction

This is a really fun and fast game. To prepare you will want to have the cards from 1-10 cut out (2 copies) and 25, 50, 75, 100 (1 copy). Keep the small number cards in a separate pile to the larger number cards.   

For the first few games you might want to intentionally pick cards with easier numbers, and a smaller target. E.g. numbers 2,3,5,8,10,100 and target 253   

Students do not need to use all of the cards to reach the target, but they can only use each card at most
once!   

There should somebody keeping a timer. The idea is not to spend a long time trying to reach the target
exactly, but to see who can get closest in a short amount of time. If 30 seconds is too short you could consider 1 minute.   

At the end of each round the winner is decided by whoever has a number closest to the target. They should be able to prove their solution, by writing on the board. If they have made a mistake you should go to the next closest person.   

## Solution

There is no solution, and not every game will be possible but there are some general strategies to encourage   

1.  Use the large number to get as close as possible first E.g. with numbers 2,3,4,6,8,50 and target **<u>423</u>**, think of how you might get to 400 using 50.If we start with 50 x 8 = 400 we are quite close   

2.  You can manipulate the large number before multiplication to make small changes. In the above example we know that 50 x 8 = 400, but we could also add a number to the 50 to increase the total.   
   
    I.e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50 x 8 = 400   
    
    but&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(50+2) x 8   

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=(50 x 8) + (2 x 8)   

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 400 + 32 = 416   

Which is getting close to our target of 423! and we still have 3, 4 and 6 to use.


## Extension

After a few rounds of picking cards intentionally you could let the winner pick cards for the next game. The facilitator could still pick the target, or all the cards could be put face down to make it more random.   

You could also choose only 4 small numbers alongside 2 large numbers for increased challenge
