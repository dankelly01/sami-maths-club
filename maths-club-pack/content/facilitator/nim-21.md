# Nim/21

## Introduction

At first students will play the game randomly without thinking. After everyone has played a few times tell
them to play again but really think about what numbers they say and try their best not to lose.The game can seem like luck but if you know how to play you can never lose.   

This activity is all about thinking and strategy. If you have a good strategy you have a better chance of winning. Do not just play this game a few times, you need to play a lot to work out the best way to play.   

## Solution

It is obvious that if you stop at 20, you will win. After playing a few times students realise that if you stop at
16 you cannot lose. This is because, after you say 16, the next player can say 17, 17-18 or 17-18-19. But wherever they stop you can always get to 20 on your next turn and win. If you stop at 16 your opponent can't get to 20.  

<ins>*How can we make sure we get to 16 before the other player?*<ins>

If students realise they need to get to 16, tell them to play again and ask them to think about how they can make sure they get to 16 before their opponent. Think about what we did to get from 16 to 20 and try to do the same. You should realise that if you get to 12 and stop, you will be the player who says 16, and win the game. (If you stop at 12 the other player can only get to 15.)   

<ins>*So you need to get to 12 before you opponent to win. 12-16-20. Do you see the pattern now?*<ins>  

We can see that we want to be the player who says 12, 16 and 20, then we will win. If we keep going like this we see that to make sure this happens we just need to say all the multiples of 4. If we say 4-8-12-16-20 we will win every time. So to win the game we just need to get to 4 and stop. Then we can get to 8 on the next turn and stop, and so on up to 20.   

<ins>*How can we make sure we get to 4 before the other player?*<ins> 

If you want to get to 4, should you go first or second? If you go second your opponent can only go up to 3 and you can stop at 4 on your turn. So to be sure to win the game, you want to go second.   

Once you know this strategy you will never lose this game, unless you opponent also knows and decides to go second! At first this game seems like luck, but by thinking you can create a clever strategy to win. This is what we call **Mathematical Thinking.**

## Extension

There are many different versions of Nim/21 on a separate sheet. One variation is to change the rules so that the player who says 21 is now the **winner.** How does this change the strategy you use?
