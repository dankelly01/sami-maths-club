# Paper Pieces

## Introduction

This game is designed to get students to think about winning strategy when playing games, and introduce the idea of strategy stealing.   

After students have played the game for a while ask them some of these questions.   

* Did the first or the second player tend to win more often?   

* Is it better to go first or second?   

* Is there an easy strategy for one player to always win?   

After discussing some of these things get the students to play again, and this time ask them to see if they can come up with a strategy that always wins for one of the players.


## Solution

There is a winning strategy for the second player who can just copy the first player's moves, i.e. if the first
player fills two cells in the first/second row, the second player just fills out the cells below/above in the second/first row respectively. It's always possible for the second player to do such a move, and thus it will always be the first player who at some point can't make a move anymore. Having a winning strategy that just copies the other player's moves is called strategy stealing.   

## Variation
Ask the students to play the game on a strip that has an even number of cells first.   

After having played for a while, ask the same three questions as for the first version of the game. If they've
seen the winning strategy for the first version of the game, ask if they can somehow use a similar strategy for the variation.   

The winning strategy here is for the first player to mark the two cells in the middle of the strip. Then we are
left with two identical pieces of the strip to the left and to the right of these marked cells. Now when the second player makes a move on the right/left half, the first player can just copy that move on the left/right respectively in the same vein as in the winning strategy for the original game.

## Extension

You can have the students also play the game on the paper-strip with an odd number of cells. However, in this case there is no easy winning strategy. You can ask them to play the game on strips with small numbers of cells, and see for which numbers the first player and for which numbers the second player can always win. (Example: for 3 and 7 cells the first player always wins, for 5 cells the second player always wins. For 9 cells the second player can always win, but the analysis is a bit more complicated because the first player can win if the second player doesn't react correctly to the first player's move.)
