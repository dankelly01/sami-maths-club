# Magic Cards

## Introduction
Place the cards randomly on the desk and ask a student to find all the cards with their birth date on (e.g. they might be born on the 12th of November 2005 so they would be looking for all the cards with a 12 on it).   

Ask them to tell you the colour of all the cards that their number is on.  

Then all you need to do is add together the top left number of each of those cards and it will instantly tell you what date they were born on.  

Do this a few times with the students. They can pick any new number for you to guess.
Then ask them to work out how you are doing it so quickly.   

They should look for patterns on the cards.  

The answer to this puzzle is to use binary numbers, so it could be given to students who have already seen binary numbers, or it could be done as a discovery of binary numbers at the same time as P15 Poisoned Wine puzzle and P17 Russian Multiplication and then binary numbers discussed at the end. 

## Solution

If you line up the cards in order from the biggest number in the top left to the smallest number in the top left, they are:

16,8,4,2,1  

The numbers have been written on the cards so that if a number is on the card it means its binary equivalent has a 1 in that column.  

e.g. the number 21 is 10101, so it would be on the 16 card, the 4 card and the 1 card.


## Extension
Turn over the cards so that the students canâ€™t see them. 
Can students recreate the cards themselves?
If you added one more card, how many more numbers could you do the trick with? Can you make up the new set of six cards?
